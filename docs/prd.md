# Product Requirements Document: CodeRunner

## Executive Summary

CodeRunner is an asynchronous, high-performance sandboxed code and database execution engine built on Node.js/Express, Redis/BullMQ, Docker, and Linux cgroup sandboxes (Isolate). It provides pure execution semantics—compiling, running, and isolating untrusted code and queries, and returning execution telemetry (`stdout`, `stderr`, duration, memory, and exit codes) without embedded grading side-effects.

> Credits: Based on foundational concepts by Chai aur Code / Hitesh Choudhary, customized and rewritten for pure code and database execution with ephemeral warm pools and native multi-file orchestration.

## Product Vision

Deliver a secure, low-latency code execution engine capable of executing arbitrary untrusted code across major programming languages with strong sandboxing guarantees, supporting both single-file executions and multi-file projects.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Pure Execution Model
- Accepts source code, standard input (`stdin`), and resource limits.
- Executes code inside a restricted sandbox environment.
- Returns process execution results (`stdout`, `stderr`, `time`, `wall_time`, `memory`, `exit_code`, `status`).
- Does not compare outputs or assign grading judgments like "Wrong Answer"—evaluation belongs in client/consumer applications.

### 2. Multi-File Project Orchestration (`POST /submissions/multi`)
- Accepts a collection of files in structured JSON (`path`, `content`).
- Compiles the project once inside a single dedicated sandbox environment.
- Preserves relative subdirectories (`models/User.java`, `src/app.py`).
- Sequentially executes multiple entry points against the same compiled environment.
- Implements fail-fast isolation: if an execution crashes or times out, the container is terminated immediately.

### 3. Hardened Sandboxing
- Multi-engine support: **Docker** container sandboxing and **Isolate** Linux cgroups namespaces.
- Enforces `ReadonlyRootfs`, dropped Linux capabilities (`CapDrop: ALL`), and `no-new-privileges`.
- Memory isolation with swap disabled, CPU quota limits, and PID execution bounds.
- Path traversal defense preventing writes outside the working `/box` directory.

### 4. Language Support
- Clean sequential language identifiers:
  - `1`: C (GCC 9.4.0)
  - `2`: C++ (GCC 9.4.0)
  - `3`: Java (OpenJDK 17)
  - `4`: JavaScript (Node.js 18.15.0)
  - `5`: Python (3.8.10)
  - `6`: TypeScript (5.0.3)
  - `7`: SQL (SQLite 3)
